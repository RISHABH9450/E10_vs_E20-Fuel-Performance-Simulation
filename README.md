# E10 vs E20 Fuel Performance Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the performance of spark-ignition engines running on E10 and E20 ethanol–petrol blends. The simulation models brake power, torque, brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and thermal efficiency for varying engine speeds, with realistic volumetric efficiency and brake thermal efficiency variations.

Gaussian noise is added to emulate real-world dynamometer test data.

## Features
- Adjustable engine parameters
- Fuel-specific properties for E10 and E20
- Realistic performance curves
- Noise injection for experimental realism
- Automated export of results to PNG and PDF

## Tools & Technologies
- **MATLAB** – Numerical computation & plotting
- **Thermodynamic Engine Modeling** – Performance calculation
